# 📖 Overview

Codeforces Analytics Hub is a React-based analytics dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of a programmer's Codeforces profile.

Instead of simply displaying ratings, the application transforms a user's submission history into meaningful insights such as:

* Rating statistics
* Topic-wise strengths and weaknesses
* Solved problem distribution
* Weak topic detection
* Unsolved backlog
* Upcoming contests
* Recent submissions

The project is designed with a clean and modular architecture using reusable React components.
